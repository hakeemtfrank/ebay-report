# ebay_report
A simple Python script that prompts two ebay users to compare, given the presence of their sales history data .csv file.

The first version is a rough draft with minimal use of loops. Eventually the program should be able to scrape data, run analysis, make comparisons, and report on the findings in a user-friendly way.
